# NextJS - Test Assignment
This is a test assignment for creating a Next.js app with Material Design Framework and using Firebase's Firestore database. The goal is to implement a create project screen with specific features.

# Features
## Material Design Framework: 
The app should be built using the Material Design Framework to ensure a modern and visually appealing user interface.

## Firebase Firestore Database: 
The app should use Firebase's Firestore database to store and retrieve project data.

## Create Project Screen: 
The main feature to implement is the create project screen, which should include the following functionalities:

## Table View: 
The user should be able to see a table with all the existing projects. This table should display relevant information about each project, such as project name, description, and other details.

## Project Details Modal:
When the user clicks on a project in the table, a modal should be displayed showing the details of the selected project. The modal should contain information such as project name, description, and any other relevant details.

## Add New Project:
The user should have the ability to add a new project. This could be achieved through a form or input fields where the user can enter project details such as name, description, and any other required information. Upon submission, the new project should be saved in the Firestore database.
